<p class="text-gray-700 text-xl mb-4">The Assam Government and Tata Group have signed a deal to set up a semiconductor plant in Jagiroad, Morigaon district. The agreement involves leasing over 170 acres of land for Rs 27,000 crore. The 60-year lease was signed at the sub-registrar's office. Key figures present included Ranjan Bandopadhyay from Tata Group and Dhiraj Pegu from Assam Industrial Development Corporation.

    District Commissioner Devasish Sharma, along with Tata Group officials, also attended the event. Sharma highlighted the importance of this deal for Assam. The new facility will replace the former Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited site. This project is expected to create over 30,000 jobs. The first phase should be operational by mid-2025.
    
    The land transfer is complete, and Tata Group plans to start work soon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation for the plant virtually on March 13. The plant will focus on three key technologies: wire bond, flip chip, and integrated systems packaging (ISP). It will also advance in packaging technologies. The plant aims to meet the rising global demands in AI, industrial, and consumer electronics.
