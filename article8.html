<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">CrowdStrike and Microsoft: What we know about global IT outage</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 text-xl mb-4">A recent global IT outage caused major disruptions in travel, banking, and healthcare services. Flights were grounded, leading to long queues and delays at airports worldwide. The culprit? An update to CrowdStrike’s antivirus software, which protects Microsoft Windows devices.

    CrowdStrike admitted the flaw and took responsibility. The company's CEO, George Kurtz, clarified that the issue affected only Windows PCs and was not a security breach. A rogue file in the update was the problem, and a fix was deployed. However, the fix requires manual application and reboots, creating headaches for IT departments.
    
    Microsoft is also addressing the aftermath. The tech giant recommended multiple reboots for some virtual machines, a classic troubleshooting method. For IT professionals, deleting a specific file could resolve the issue. Personal devices, such as home computers and mobile phones, were not affected.
    
    The outage's impact was severe. Over 3,300 flights were canceled globally, with significant disruptions in Australia, the UK, the US, and other countries. Airlines like Ryanair and British Airways faced cancellations, while US carriers like United, Delta, and American Airlines were grounded for much of the day. The chaos extended to payment systems, banking, and healthcare providers. Even emergency services in Alaska and Sky News broadcasts were affected.
    
    The outage also threatened payroll processing. Many businesses couldn’t access payroll software, potentially delaying staff payments. However, CrowdStrike's software is mainly used by businesses, so personal devices were largely unaffected.
    
    CrowdStrike, a Texas-based cybersecurity firm, is usually a problem solver in cyber incidents. Founded in 2011, it has grown rapidly and is listed on the US stock exchange. The company's involvement in high-profile cyber-attacks highlights the complexity of modern digital infrastructure. With nearly 24,000 customers, the scale of this issue is vast, but efforts are underway to restore normalcy.
