<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">AI impacting jobs in gaming industry, studios using GenAI to create concept art and graphics</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 text-xl mb-4">AI is changing the gaming industry. Game studios now use GenAI tools to create concept art and graphics. These tools include programs like MidJourney and DALL-E. They help studios cut costs and speed up production.

    This shift impacts jobs in the gaming sector. Many artists and designers are losing their positions. Studios prefer AI tools because they are cheaper and faster. This trend is causing concern among human workers.
    
    In 2023, around 10,500 people in the gaming industry lost their jobs to AI. This number rose to 11,000 in 2024. Studios are not filling vacancies with humans anymore. Instead, they rely on AI to meet their needs.
    
    A survey by CVL Economics found that the gaming industry uses GenAI more than other entertainment sectors. Nearly 90% of video game companies have adopted these tools. AI now handles tasks like storyboarding, character design, and animation.
    
    Major companies like Microsoft and Activision have also made changes. Microsoft laid off many 2D artists and shut down some studios. Activision started using AI for creating art and marketing materials, leading to layoffs.
    
    The rise of AI in gaming is clear. It helps companies save money and work efficiently. However, it also means fewer jobs for human artists and designers. The industry must find a balance to protect human creativity and employment.
