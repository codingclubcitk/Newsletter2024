<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">After US, India to sign 6G co-operation agreement with European body</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 text-xl mb-4">India's Bharat 6G Alliance and the European telecom body Industry Alliance 6G are preparing to sign a cooperation agreement. This partnership aims to advance the development of 6G technology. According to sources, the agreement is expected to be signed soon, with formalities to be completed in the coming months.

    This collaboration is reminiscent of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) Bharat 6G signed with the United States in September 2023. The Bharat 6G Alliance, launched by India's Department of Telecommunications, aims to unite industry players, academia, and research organizations to advance 6G technology.
    
    The partnership with the European Union follows a series of high-tech collaborations between India and Europe, including a recent MoU on semiconductor cooperation. The cooperation agreement will focus on establishing standards and promoting research and development in 6G technology.
    
    The Bharat 6G Alliance seeks to position India at the forefront of 6G innovation by bringing together startups, companies, and the manufacturing ecosystem. It aims to accelerate patent creation and contribute to international standardization organizations.
    
    India's participation in the International Telecom Union, which has accepted India's 6G vision document, further solidifies its role in shaping global 6G standards. This agreement with the European body marks another significant step in India's journey towards becoming a leader in 6G technology.
